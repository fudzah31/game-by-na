> An underground Android game lab — built not for fame, but for the vibe.  
> Made as a **practice playground for kids**, but coded in the midnight chaos. 🌑

## ⚡ Tech Arsenal
- ☕ **Java** → brain of the beast  
- 🩸 **XML** → shaping the skeleton (UI layouts)  
- 🗄 **SQLite** → keeping memories alive, offline  
- 🔥 **Gradle** → cuz Android said “no mercy”

## 🕹 Core Features
- 🎲 Easy gameplay (kids can vibe too)  
- 🧛 Dark-ish minimal UI (XML sorcery)  
- 📱 Offline survival (SQLite blood pact)  
- 🌀 Built as a **training ground**, not perfection

## ☠️ Current State
Not stable. Not clean.  
Just raw code energy ⚡  
Expect glitches, bugs, and broken nights.  
But that’s what makes it alive 🕷

## 🔮 Screens (soon)
📸 Screenshots may appear… or maybe never.  
Just imagine neon pixels glowing in the dark. 🌌

## 🖤 Final Words
This repo isn’t about **perfection**,  
it’s about **expression**.
